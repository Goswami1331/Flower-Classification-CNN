## 1. Introduction

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using the **TensorFlow/Keras** framework for a **multiclass image classification** task. The objective is to classify images into one of five distinct flower species, showcasing the ability of CNNs to learn complex, fine-grained visual features necessary for accurate categorization.

## 2. Problem Statement

The goal is to develop an image classification model that accurately distinguishes between five species: **Daisy, Dandelion, Rose, Sunflower, and Tulip**. This task requires robust feature extraction to handle visual similarities and variations caused by lighting and angle.

## 3. Dataset Used

* **Classes:** 5 unique flower species.
* **Source:** A public domain subset of a flower classification dataset.
* **Preprocessing:** Images were normalized to the $[0, 1]$ range and dynamically augmented (rotation, shift, flip) during training via the `ImageDataGenerator` to expand the training data and improve generalization. The data is organized into class-specific folders within the `data/flower_dataset/` directory.

## 4. Model Architecture

* **Framework:** TensorFlow (Keras API)
* **Input Size:** $64 \times 64$ RGB image
* **Optimizer:** Adam
* **Loss Function:** Categorical Crossentropy
* **Network Layers:**
    * **2 Convolutional Blocks:** Using 32 and 64 filters, each followed by **MaxPooling2D** and **Dropout (0.25)** for regularization.
    * **Classification Head:** A **Flatten** layer feeds into a $\text{Dense}(\mathbf{128}, \text{relu})$ layer with $\text{Dropout}(\mathbf{0.5})$, ending with a $\text{Dense}(\mathbf{5}, \text{softmax})$ output layer.

## ðŸ“Š Section 6: Results 


## 6. Evaluation Metrics and Results

The model was trained for 20 epochs. The final performance was measured on the 20% validation split of the dataset.

| Metric | Result |
| :--- | :--- |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Validation Loss** | **1.1821** |
| **Validation Accuracy** | **0.5385 (53.85%)** |



## 7. Insights and Challenges

The achieved accuracy of **53.85%** is significantly higher than the 20% random guess baseline, confirming the CNN successfully learned discriminative features. The primary challenges addressed were:
* **Overfitting:** Mitigated by aggressive use of **Dropout layers** and dynamic **Data Augmentation** to enhance the model's ability to generalize.
* **Multiclass Confusion:** The high loss (**1.1821**) suggested confusion between visually similar species, addressed by increasing the capacity of the final Dense layer to 128 neurons.
